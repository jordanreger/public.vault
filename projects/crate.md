Crate was a project that I worked on for about 2 years. It started as a very simple web server (as they all do), and it progressed into a tool to create native apps via Deno. It then returned to a web server after I realized that creating native apps via Deno was a bit tough. Life got in the way, and I realized that as the Deno ecosystem got bigger and better, there was really no reason to make just another web server. There's tons of better ones... [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/), [Ultra](https://ultrajs.dev/), [Aleph](https://alephjs.org/), you name it. In fact, they’re so good I encourage you to go test them out, at the very least. You’ll learn a ton. For now, however, Crate is on hold. I have an idea I’d love to implement, but I don’t have the time at the moment. I encourage you to watch for updates on my [blog](https://jordanreger.com) for more news, but for now, Crate is signing off.
