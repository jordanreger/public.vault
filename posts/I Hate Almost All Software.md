This article is based on [an article with the same name](https://tinyclouds.org/rant) written by Ryan Dahl. I would highly recommend reading that first, because frankly nothing has changed in the 12 years since it was written. Ryan Dahl is the creator of Deno and Node.js (my favorite and least favorite software tools ever made, respectively; I'll come back to this), and he is probably one of the most knowledgeable people when it comes to minimalistic, utilitarian software. However, obviously, I also have a few things to say about it.

There's only one thing I care about when writing software: being able to understand and explain it. I respect people who find ways to make calculated and insane jumps to save time calculating an [inverse square root](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root), but I simply can't do that. If I can't explain to you *how* and *why* I did something, I probably did it without thinking - which isn't a good thing when it's potentially mission-critical software. Yes, it may take more time, resources, and lines of code, but if that's what it takes to be able to *understand what I'm saying*, so be it. Complication in places it doesn't need to be is annoying and creates a spirit of elitism.
