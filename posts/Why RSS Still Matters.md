RSS feeds are a great way to allow yourself to receive only the information you want in the places you want it. Frankly, I’m not sure why we moved away from it - Twitter, Substack, basically any social media, every news outlet, etc. all have (or used to have) RSS feeds and I think there was a good reason for that. It allowed you to be mindful of the content you were ingesting, compared to today’s infinite stream of content. The main principle of mindfulness (in a secular sense) is to remove yourself from the constant movement of thoughts and emotions, and to simply observe them. This allows you to become more aware of those thoughts and emotions, but more importantly of your reaction to them. This is what I believe RSS feeds can do today. They can be an escape from the chaotic flood of content that social platforms and news outlets provide. My favorite feature is that RSS feeds don’t completely cut off your access to the rest of the internet; they actually encourage it. The difference is that it provides you a link to just the content you want to see, not the content you want plus a bunch of cat videos.

This is the beauty of RSS.
