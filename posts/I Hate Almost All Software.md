This article is based on [an article with the same name](https://tinyclouds.org/rant) written by Ryan Dahl. I would highly recommend reading that first, because frankly nothing has changed in the 12 years since it was written. Ryan Dahl is the creator of Deno and Node.js (my favorite and least favorite software tools ever made, respectively; I'll come back to this), and he is probably one of the most knowledgeable people when it comes to minimalistic, utilitarian software. However, obviously, I also have a few things to say about it.

As he mentions in his post, there is certainly respect due to people who can quickly and easily solve a problem in a minimal manner, especially on top of massive piles of terrible code. This, however, does not excuse how vastly complex it is to start with. [Plan 9](https://9p.io/plan9/) by Bell Labs (the actively maintained version that you can try today is called [9front](https://9front.org/)) is a beautiful example of when software engineers take a step back, try to cut through the massive web they created while they were solving a (granted, massive) problem, and use what they learned to make something *better*. If you don't know Bell Labs or need a refresher, they were the breeding ground for some of the greatest technological advances we saw through the second half of the last century: C, C++, transistors, lasers, photovoltaic cells, and most importantly (to this post): Unix. Seriously though, if you haven't looked into them at all, check out [their Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs). ***Nine*** Nobel Prizes have been awarded to engineers there.
