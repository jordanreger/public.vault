For the past year or so, I’ve been learning about urban planning and how the suburban experiment overstayed its welcome. I have Dave Schul from the Ohio State University and Jason from the Youtube channel “Not Just Bikes” to thank for that. It’s become a priority of mine to find somewhere that can accommodate an urbanist lifestyle while staying within reason (which would be impossible in most “urbanist” places near me). To help guide me on my journey to an urbanist lifestyle, I’ve decided to make this Urban Master Plan. Disclaimer: each phase - until completed or nearly completed - is a very informal plan and has the potential to not happen. However, it's a good tool to form a plan for the future. This will most certainly be updated every once in a while, because plans change.

# Phase 1
Phase 1 involves getting a job in Columbus or somewhere near it; this is my first stepping stone. Delaware is certainly a decent spot, cheap and accessible. I can live here and save money, while still being close enough to Columbus to access what I want and my (future) job.

# Phase 2
Phase 2 involves getting a bigger/better job. This could be remote, or more likely, in Chicago. I’ve been to Chicago and it's a beautiful city. It’s also quite walkable… Most necessities are within a short walk, and the public transit is also fairly decent (it's fairly frequent, at 5-10 minutes depending on the day).

# Phase 3
Phase 3 is the most vague of them all: find a place in Europe, probably the Netherlands, Sweden, etc.; buy a bakfiets (a cargo bike essentially); settle down. This is my ultimate goal - if it takes me all my life, so be it. If you're confused by that, I recommend watching some [Not Just Bikes videos](https://youtube.com/@notjustbikes). Anyways, wherever I happen to settle down will be for a while, if not forever, although it won't be the end of my travels.

# Conclusion
It’s a little bit crazy to seek out a way of life like this, but in a country where the infrastructure is hostile to a healthy way of life, it's necessary. Thankfully, not every city in the country is as hostile as others, as I’m finding out. Everyday I strive for a better lifestyle, and I believe that the environment you find yourself in is certainly a large factor.
