I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) because it's a clean, local-first way to keep track of everything I need. It also helps me produce great things, especially with the extensive plugin repository. Here's how I use Obsidian.

## Syncing
I use iCloud Drive and [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) to back my vaults up between my devices *and* the web.

## Publishing
I use [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy) and a [custom server](https://github.com/jordanreger/public.vault/blob/main/main.ts) to host it on the web.

## Slides
[Advanced Slides](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides) is what I use to make my [slide decks](/decks).
